# FCC-Drum-Machine
## Functionality
* This web app was developed to satisfy a portion of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Front End Libraries certification. 
* The test suite for this project appears as an overlay on the upper left-hand corner of the app, and it can be run by selecting Drum Machine from the drop-down box, and clicking "run tests".
* The primary function of the app is to play audio when each button is clicked, or if the corresponding key is pressed on the keyboard.
* The app was designed to be responsive to changes in browser width, device size and text size. 

## Web App Deployment
* If you would like to view the app itself, it's been deployed on GitHub pages! Please see [the deployed Drum Machine web app here](https://laurashultz.github.io/FCC-Drum-Machine/).
* If you are interested in downloading the project and viewing it locally, you may clone the repo, navigate to the directory, and run the command `npm start` to view it in a local environment. If the command is run in the root directory of the repository, the app will be viewable by navigating to "localhost:3000" in your web browser.

## Future Updates
* Volume control
* Multiple drum kit banks

## Issues
* If you encounter any loss of functionality at any time while using the app, I would appreciate feedback!
